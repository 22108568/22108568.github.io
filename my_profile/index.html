HOME PAGE Rumen Rumenov Marchev

<h1><u>
Who am I?
</u></h1>
<h2>
I am Rumen Rumenov Marchev. I am a delivery guy and a mechanic, working for myself as self employed. Me and my dad work together as 50/50, because we do the work together quicker and if he needs help with translation, I can help him all time. I also like to play videogames in my free time, talk with friends, do something in Blender or do martial arts, mainly Muay Thai. I also have a VR headset with which I have thought about maybe creating some VR games, but apparently C# is outdated and I just dislike Unreal Engine's block coding.
</h2>
<h1><u>
What IT device do I use at home?
</u></h1>

<h2>
I have a quite powerful PC on which I mentioned previously that I play games on and the fact that it can handle the VR environment that it creates. I have stress tested my PC so bad at some points by running 4 virtual machines with different operating systems on each one and to be honest, it does very well. Just starting up a 5th one makes it give up on me. I also have a laptop which is as good as my previous phone in it's prime... By that I mean quite slow as it's now running on Linux and opening up a terminal makes it choke. Also the VR headset and my trusty mobile phone.
</h2>
<h1><u>
Which school or college did I attend?
</u></h1>
<h2>
I have attended 3 schools before I ended up in this college. 2 of them are in Bulgaria "forgot to mention that I'm from there" which were a meh,  but I did quite meh too. I spent 4 years in my first one from year 1 to year 4 and then 3 years in my second one from year 5 to year 7. Year 7 was my last year in Bulgaria and moved into Ysgol Clywedog down in Wrexham. That's when they told me that I'm moving 2 years up. I jumped straight into year 10 and I was quite happy that high school finishes sooner then I thought. The 2 years that I was in this school for year 10 and 11 were two hell of years as most of the time I was lost in my own lessons. After the 2 years finished, I realised I got a D in English and my hopes of getting into Level 3 were pretty much cancelled.. or so I thought. They moved me into a Level 2 course on the same principals that was preparing me for Level 3. From my Level 2 course I figured out how the assignments work and how to get the highest criteria without the need to think about it as much as I tried in high school. All of that and boom. I'm now here.

<h1><u>
What IT experience I have?
</u></h1>
<h2>
Well... I'm still chasing up this question right now as I'm thinking about what to write. Hardware? Well, I know how to take apart a computer, clean it up and put it back together. I really love working on hardware, especially if I know that it can't be fixed. I take it as a challenge to either fix it or break it even more. Jokes or maybe jokes aside, I know how to handle the insides of technological devices quite well, like I said computers, I know how to build one from the broken down components. Networking? I do know how to work with a router, like wiring up the router with LAN cables and then access it from the pc. Pretty sure the default way to access it is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley">https://192.168.0.1</a> <--- don't click this by the way), but eh, who knows. Evey router is different and unique, like people, or maybe that's for the IP address for a house.

<h1><u>
Why am I doing this course?
</u></h1>
<h2>
I feel like other then "Games and IT", this course would give me quite a lot of opportunities in the near future (about 5 years) to pursue one of my many choices of careers. I need the knowledge for one of my current profession that I am currently chasing by hardware. Since mechanics are quite easier, because of the ECUs inside the cars pretty much tell you about the problems that the car has. Cars and their ECUs now-a-days also use coding to run. My father is a hardware engineer. He is able to invent things by thinking how it would work, what will it do and will it help him. With his trusty tools, he's able to make crazy DIYs. I want to be able to do the same things, but in computers, like for an example make my customised reminders or let's say a program that starts up with windows that while the computer is running, every half an hour it throws some sort of flash card for exam revisions.
</h2>
<h1><u>
What career do I want?
</u></h1>
<h2>
Well... they are changing between 2 or 3 careers. First one is possible, but not really ideal and it's to become a professional kick boxing/Muay Thai champion. The second one is quite likely to happen, but it's a few different paths, so still unsure. It's to carry on doing the Computer Science and either go work for a big company in videogame company to work for them, start my own small indie game company or work in Cyber Security. The third one is the one that I'm mainly going for and it's being a mechanic and fixing cars and motorbikes. I have this idea that if the business that I'm working on starts to roll off, I go and get a degree in auto mechanics, but if it doesn't, I stay on track with Computer Science.
